<ul>
  <li>
    Replacing for loops with apply() and related functions
  </li>
  <li>
    Parallel processing using parApply(), mcapply(), and related functions from the parallel package
  </li>
  <li>
    Improving performance with C++ and the Rcpp package
  </li>
  <li>
    Implementing large scale linear algebra on a GPU using cuda
  </li>
  <li>
    Solving fixed effects regression problems using sparse matix methods and Rcpp
  </li>
  <li>
    Using alternative Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) modules 
  <li>
    Using the Slurm sbatch and srun commands for scheduling and executing R scripts
